Catacomb-Snatch
===============

Old project used as one of my French "BTS informatique de gestions" degree project, and also my first personal project. So, it's made before my Epitech formation / auto-formation ;).

The projects requirement for the degree project was :
- softwares able to create, modify, save and delete data in any language and any form"
- show your knowledge
- being able to modify and create new feature during the presentation

It's a shoot 'em up strategy game with steampunk and Ancient Egypt themes on Java Platform.
It's made using Mojang "mojam" open source project called "Catacomb snatch", made in a two days of rush, then develloped by community.

Started with one of this project early release in 02/2012 : https://github.com/Maescool/Catacomb-Snatch

My part is most of the level editor, some tiles and mobs, some animations, some console commands.
